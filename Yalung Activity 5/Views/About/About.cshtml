    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>Y’all already know who I am! I’m Samuel L. Jackson—Hollywood’s go-to guy for delivering legendary lines, dropping F-bombs like poetry, and making every role iconic. From Jedi Master to hitman, from Marvel’s top spy to Tarantino’s favorite scene-stealer, I bring the energy, the attitude, and the damn presence. Whether I’m rocking a purple lightsaber or handling snakes on a damn plane, one thing’s for sure—when I show up, you pay attention. Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the mother—well, you get the idea.</p>
